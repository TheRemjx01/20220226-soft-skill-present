## Format guideline

- Be specific & concise.
- Writing your CV in English.
- Check your spelling & grammar carefully


---

- Avoid non-academy vocabulary
- Prepare the PDF file (make sure it is able to copy/paste)
- No fancy graphics, fonts (you're the software engineer, not the designer)

---

### Not have working experiences
- Try to list down your school projects.
- Moving your `skills` & `education` part to the top

----

### Prove your interests.

- Your GitHub
- Your personal blog (it's prove your front-end skills here. So please don't make it too ugly)
- Your pet project (remember to include the technology stacks & the URL)

### Aim the target

- Know your company that you apply to
- Find your matches (technical skills, apply position ...)
- Orient your CV to match the requirements
