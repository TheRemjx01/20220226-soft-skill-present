## #2.2 The best practices

---

- Be relaxed. An interview is just a conversation.
- Preparing your mood. A bad mood leads to a lousy interview result.
- Collecting information about your position & company. *From: internet, buddy, referrer, HR...*
- Preparing for the **common behavioral questions** : *your weakness, strength, the most challenging problem, your career path ...*
- The answer should be short, accurate & easy to understand.


---

- Be honest.
- Unclear about something? Just ask again.
- The question is too tricky? Ask for some hints from interviewers.
- Show your passions. The mental, the mindset & the will is more important than a skillful engineer, but with a wrong mindset.
- Ask for feedback. It is helpful for your following interview, even you fail.


---

## Set up your interview corner for an online interview

- Avoid using the smartphone. Preparing your laptop with all the required software: IDE, Online Meeting, camera, microphone...
- Join the meeting early to check your sound & your camera.
- The Internet should be stable.
- Be professional. Even with an online interview, you should prepare your costume carefully.

---

- Choosing a quiet, private corner. Avoid noisy places.
- If possible, set up your interview corner at your home. 
- Using background, blur effect if everything around is too messy.
- Your camera should not be too dark. 
- Be familiar with the Online Meeting software. **how to share screen, send the files, mute...*


---

## #2.3 The common mistakes

---


- Joining late. If you can't, reschedule the interview as soon as possible
- Turning off your camera during the interview.
- Bad internet quality.
- Fail the self-introduction.


---

- Not well-prepared - even you know it, you should prepare before the interview.
- Your answer is too short, shallow & not detailed enough.
- Not confident. Too shy.
- Not ask anything.
